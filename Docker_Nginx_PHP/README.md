# PHP Debugging with Docker and Nginx

### Code Summary

These files make up a system for debugging PHP that runs in a Docker container. If a user sets a debug cookie with browser marklet, the nginx proxy server points to a Docker container that has debugging enabled. For development purposes only!

### Background

I wanted to include some work from my most recent role, but most of it was deeply entwined in the Drupal ecosystem and harder to disentangle and present. So this is a small DevOps oriented project that shows I can work with other technologies. It also shows I can write user-facing documentation. The goal was to make Docker-based PHP/Drupal more accesible for new contributers.

I completed this work in January 2020 for the Metropolitan New York Library Council. All code is open source. You can read the documentation I wrote [here](https://github.com/esmero/archipelago-documentation/blob/8.x-1.0-beta2/docs/xdebug.md).

*Please note: These files have been removed from their original directory structures for presentation purposes.*
